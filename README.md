 # GitHub Project Recommender

Intelligent Open-Source Discovery powered by Knowledge Graphs & LLMs.

Traditional GitHub search relies on simple keyword matching. This project takes a different approach: it models the GitHub ecosystem as a Knowledge Graph, allowing you to find projects based on relationships rather than just text.

**Example Query:** "Show me popular Python projects for data visualization that use the library 'matplotlib'."

**Recommendation:** Precise, ranked results based on actual dependency and topic connections.

## How It Works (Architecture)

This system bridges the gap between unstructured natural language and structured graph data:

### The Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)

We ingest thousands of GitHub repositories into a graph database.

**Nodes:** Repository, ProgrammingLanguage, TopicTag.

**Relationships:** (:Repository)-[:IS_WRITTEN_IN]->(:Language), (:Repository)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(:Topic).

### The Reasoning Engine (LLM)

When a user asks a question, an LLM (via OpenRouter/OpenAI) analyzes their intent and translates it into a precise Cypher query.

### The Application

A Streamlit frontend executes the Cypher query against the graph database and presents the structured results.

## Key Features

**Natural Language Search:** No need to learn complex query languages. Ask naturally.

**Graph-Based Retrieval:** Finds projects based on deep connections (e.g., projects that use a specific library or are maintained by a certain owner).

**Transparent Reasoning:** "Debug Mode" allows developers to see the exact Cypher query generated by the AI.

**Real-Time Data:** Queries a live local database of GitHub metadata.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+

- Neo4j Desktop (Installed and running locally)

- An API Key from OpenRouter or OpenAI for the LLM.

### Installation

**Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/shahrukhfu/Github-Project-Recommending-Agent.git

**Install Dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt


**Setup Database (Ingestion)**

1. Start your Neo4j Database.

2. Update your credentials in ingest_graph.py.

3. Run the ingestion script to populate the graph:

⋅⋅⋅⋅1. python ingest_graph.py

⋅⋅⋅⋅2. Run the App

⋅⋅⋅⋅3. Add your API Key to the llm_helper.py file.

⋅⋅⋅⋅4. Launch the frontend:

⋅⋅⋅⋅5. streamlit run app.py
